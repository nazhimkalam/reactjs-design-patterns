# React Design Patterns

- Design patterns are effective solutions to common application development challenges.
- They are a way to structure your code so that it is easy to understand and maintain.
- They are a way to solve problems that are difficult to solve with traditional approaches.

1. **Layout Components** - These are the components that are used to layout the application. Note that these components needs to be reusable. Hence these components should be **developed** in such a way that they can be used in multiple places.

2. **Container Components** - Components that take care of loading and managing data for their child components.

3. **Controlled and Uncontrolled Components** 

4. **Higher Order Components** 

5. **Custom Hooks Patterns**

6. **Functional Programming**
